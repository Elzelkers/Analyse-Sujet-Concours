# Statistic for French CPGE competitive exam.

This is an Electron app that can be downloaded on Linux, Mac and Windows. The app facilitates the access to all the statistics of the exams, especially for orienting revisions. The application gives the percentages of the main subjects appearing in the CPGE subjects in function of the subject, the path, the concours exams and the dates, based on [Doc Solus](https://www.doc-solus.fr/) database.

# How to use it ? 

In the preparatory weeks before the Concours: I advise you to create an excel document to keep a register of the subject that you will do: for example, an array with subjects in line and main chapters in column. Then use colors to indicate the proportion of each chapter in the subject.

To choose the next chapter, you will take into account the chapters little covered by reading the excel document and the subject that fall the most thanks to the application.

# Downloading.

Binaries are in [Release](https://github.com/Elzelkers/Analyse-Sujet-Concours/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

# Warning.

This app is mainly generated by AI (Claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking in Cursor), therefore note that the code is not optimised and not secure.
