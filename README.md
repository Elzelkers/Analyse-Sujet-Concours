## Statistic for French CPGE competitive exam.

This is an Electron app available for download on Linux, Mac, and Windows. The app provides access to statistics related to the CPGE exams, specifically designed to help guide your revision process. It displays the percentages of the main subjects featured in the CPGE exams, organized by subject, pathway, concours exams, and dates, all based on the [Doc Solus](https://www.doc-solus.fr/) database.

## How to use it ? 

During the preparatory weeks before the concours, I recommend creating an Excel document to track the subjects you plan to study. For example, create a table with subjects listed in rows and main chapters in columns. Use color coding to indicate the proportion of each chapter in each subject.

To decide on the next topic to focus on, consider the following:

- Chapters you've covered less: look for rows with fewer colors in your Excel document.
- Chapters that are most frequently tested: check the statistics provided by the app.

Once you've identified the keywords or chapters you want to revise, visit the [Doc-solus database](https://www.doc-solus.fr/) (free of charge) and use the "Travailler un chapitre" search feature, which lists all the subjects per concours and provides independent questions numbers for each subject.

## Downloading.

You can find the binaries in the [Release section](https://github.com/Elzelkers/Analyse-Sujet-Concours/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Warning.

This app was primarily developed by AI (Claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking in Cursor). Please note that the code is not optimized and may not be secure.
